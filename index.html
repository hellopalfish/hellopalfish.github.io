  <h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>I'm really pleased you've decided to find out more. This may be an ideal opportunity, but it also might not be right for you.</p>

<p>If you're able to turn on your enthusiasm for children who want to learn English, have a lot of energy, and can have fun at the same time, this might be the right opportunity. You'll also need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable internet connection, but if you're already teaching online you'll already have this.</li>
<li>A quiet environment to teach from, just as you'd aleady do for Verbling.</li>
<li>A decent Android or iPhone as all the courses are taught from your phone.</li>
<li>A neutral accent that's from Australia, Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, or New Zealand.</li>
<li>Some experience teaching kids in any capacity.</li>
<li>The ability to teach classes for 10 hours a week.</li>
<li>Have a teaching certificate, such as TEFL or TESOL.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>If you don't already have a teaching certificate, PalFish accepts certificates granted by IOL after successfully completing the course. It's fairly inexpensive too: </p>

<p>Here's what you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base rate of $7.25 per class, that increases to $10.15 as you teach more classes.</li>
<li>An easy 75c bonus just for every class you show up on time for.</li>
<li>A monthly $30 bonus if you show up for all your classes on time in a month.</li>
<li>A $14.50 bonus just for signing up as a new teacher.</li>
<li>A $30 bonus when a student signs up for a course after taking a trial class with you. Many students will sign up after taking a class with you, so you're going to be getting these bonuses regularly.</li>
<li>Full payment for every trial class you do, just as you'd get for a normal student.</li>
<li>Another $30 bonus if you have a student you'd like to recommend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Payment is made once a month via Payoneer. If you don't have a Payoneer account, you can sign up here.</p>

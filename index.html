Hello there!

I'm really pleased you've decided to find out more. This may be an ideal opportunity, but it also might not be right for you.

If you're able to turn on your enthusiasm for children who want to learn English, have a lot of energy, and can have fun at the same time, this might be the right opportunity. You'll also need the following:
* A stable internet connection, but if you're already teaching online you'll already have this.
* A quiet environment to teach from, just as you'd aleady do for Verbling.
* A decent Android or iPhone as all the courses are taught from your phone.
* A neutral accent that's from Australia, Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, or New Zealand.
* Some experience teaching kids in any capacity.
* The ability to teach classes for 10 hours a week.
* Have a teaching certificate, such as TEFL or TESOL.

If you don't already have a teaching certificate, PalFish accepts certificates granted by IOL after successfully completing the course. It's fairly inexpensive too: 

Here's what you'll get:
* A base rate of $7.25 per class, that increases to $10.15 as you teach more classes.
* An easy 75c bonus just for every class you show up on time for.
* A monthly $30 bonus if you show up for all your classes on time in a month.
* A $14.50 bonus just for signing up as a new teacher.
* A $30 bonus when a student signs up for a course after taking a trial class with you. Many students will sign up after taking a class with you, so you're going to be getting these bonuses regularly.
* Full payment for every trial class you do, just as you'd get for a normal student.
* Another $30 bonus if you have a student you'd like to recommend.

Payment is made once a month via Payoneer. If you don't have a Payoneer account, you can sign up here.
